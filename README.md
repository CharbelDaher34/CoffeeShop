# Coffee shop
This project is done using c# language and windows form on visual studio

It is composed of 4 forms, the login form, admin form, user form and a form that is a part of the admin that contains all the available products in a datagridview

I made a database on 3 files using a read and write function in my project

The admin can add, edit, delete, print products and see all of the products available in the shop

The user can see all the available products and order
